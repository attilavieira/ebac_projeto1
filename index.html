                <h2>Vocations</h2>
                <p>Characters in Tibia divide into vocations, i.e. character professions. A character's vocation determines his characteristics in many ways. For instance, a knight will quickly surpass any spellcaster in his fighting skills, while magic users such as sorcerers or druids can advance their magic levels further than any paladin or knight can ever hope to reach. There are 4 vocations players can choose from once their character has made level 8:</p>

        <div class="container" id="container-druid">
            <img src="./images/druid-vocacoes.gif" alt ="Druida"/>
            <div>
                <h3>Druid</h3>
                <p>Druids are pure magic users. Like sorcerers, they are of weak build, and their weapon skills are rather limited. But then, what do you need weapons for when you can bring down your enemies with a well-aimed blast of magic? Druids have a good number of offensive spells at their disposals, and an experienced druid with a reasonable magic level can take out enemies as well as any other vocation in Tibia. As the masters of earth and ice spells, druids are especially feared by creatures that make fire and energy damage.</p>
                <p>However, even though druids can be fearsome opponents, their magic focuses on different aspects. Being friends of nature and of everything that lives, druids concentrate on the creative and benevolent side of magic. Druids are Tibia's best healers, and their ability to cure others makes them very popular with all other vocations. Only they know how to create "Ultimate Healing" runes. Experienced druids are never short of cash because players of other vocations will be happy to pay them good money in exchange for all kinds of useful runes. Furthermore, players of all vocations appreciate to have a druid around as a life-saver, so druids have an advantage when it comes to making friends.</p>
                <p>If you prefer using powerful magic instead of brute force, and if you are also a team player who likes to cooperate with others, you should choose a druid.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="container" id="container-knight">
            <div>
                <h3>Knight</h3>
                <p>Knights are the toughest warriors in Tibia. They are strong, resilient, and they know how to wield any melee weapon with fearsome efficiency. In combat, they are always found in the front line, engaging the mightiest opponents in vicious hand-to-hand fighting. When they are travelling with others it is usually the knights who charge enemies in order to protect their companions. Because of their incredible resilience and their skilled use of shields experienced knights are almost impossible to overcome, and even if a battle is lost, it is usually the knights who are the last to fall.</p>
                <p>However, for all their prowess in combat knights do have a weakness: knights are comparatively weak when it comes to using magic. Even though they know how to cast a few spells, their magic is rather basic. For this reason knights rely on healing potions or more magically gifted characters to heal the wounds they receive in battle. However, this does not really pose a problem as knights are the best blockers in Tibia and are therefore welcome in every hunting party.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, their ability to amass large amounts of gold is legendary. Strong as they are, knights can carry immense amounts of items which they can sell for good money in any city, so knights never leave a dungeon with empty hands.</p>
                <p>If you are looking for a vocation that is easy to play and to level up, the knight is what you are looking for.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="container" id="container-paladin">
            <img src="./images/paladin-vocacoes.gif" alt ="Paladin"/>
            <div>
                <h3>Paladin</h3>
                <p>Paladins, too, are gifted melee fighters. Their ability to train melee skills is second only to that of knights. Also, they know how to handle shields very well, and experienced paladins can block most enemies even though they are not as resilient as knights. The paladins' true strength, however, is their ability to fight at a distance. Paladins are Tibia's best archers. From throwing simple stones to firing crossbows, paladins can learn to handle any distance weapon with deadly accuracy. A paladin that manages to keep away from his opponents in battle can bring down any enemy.</p>
                <p>But there is more to paladins. They are also magic users of considerable skill who have an impressive range of spells at their disposal. Even though their magic skill cannot be compared to that of pure magic users such as druids or sorcerers, paladins have access to many additional spells because they can use a large number of runes. Furthermore, paladins are the only vocation that can use holy spells so they have an immense advantage when fighting undead creatures.</p>
                <p>Paladins are the best all-rounders in Tibia. If you are looking for a good fighter who can also handle magic rather well, the paladin should be your choice.</p>

        <div class="container" id="container-sorcerer">
            <div>
                <h3>Sorcerer</h3>
                <p>Like druids, sorcerers focus on magic use. Similar to their more peaceful brethren, sorcerers require skill and patience to rise in power because their weapon skills are very limited, and just like druids sorcerers are of weak constitution. However, sorcerers have great potential. In fact, due to the offensive nature of their spells sorcerers are perhaps the most deadly of all vocations. Unlike druids who focus on the creative and benevolent side of magic, sorcerers concentrate on its dark, destructive side, and their spells can become truly devastating in higher levels. They are especially skilled in mastering energy and fire spells. Additionally, only sorcerers can create the notorious "Sudden Death" runes, and only they can learn how to cast the apocalyptic "Hell's Core" spell. An experienced sorcerer can bring down the mightiest enemies with a wink of his eye, and because of this, sorcerers are a welcome addition to any hunting party.</p>
                <p>If it is sheer magic fire and energy power you are looking for, you should go for a sorcerer.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Creatures</h2>
                <p>Creatures are the inhabitants of Tibia aside from human players and NPCs. Every different type creature has its own characteristics which make it unique.</p>
                <p>Creatures share the entire world of Tibia, so they can be found all throughout the land. They will generally stay with other creatures of their own kind, and different creatures prefer different environments. This is why you can find Deer and Rabbits in grassy places. Slimes will always be found near water (usually underground), Dwarves spend most of their time in the mines and Demons prefer places deep underground. Usually, the most dangerous places are the hardest to reach.</p>
                <p>When creatures die they leave a Corpse.</p>

                <h2>Quests</h2>
                <p>Quests are in-game challenges where a player or group of players solve challenging riddles or puzzles for a special reward; some quests in fact involve challenging Monsters a lot of time. Most quests rewards can only be obtained once per character, but some have Repeatable Tasks which can be done many times.</p>
                <p>Quests are typically started by talking with NPCs, by asking them for missions or just generally discussing with them. Other quests are more simple and consist of exploring a cave to find a reward box.</p>
